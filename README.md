Detour

Detour is a website that allows users to find interesting places along a route.

Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites

Ability to host the website, most likely locally. I would reccomed using WAMP as that is what the website was developed using.

Installing

1. Get a copy of the Detour project.
2. Install WAMP onto the machine you want to run the website on.
3. Drag the contents of the Detour folder into the www folder in the wamp directory ("C:\wamp\www") or unzip into this location if you have a .zip or .rar file.
4. Start the WAMP server.
5. Open the local host page either via the WAMP icon in the task tray or by typing "localhost" into the browser address bar and hitting the "Enter" key.
